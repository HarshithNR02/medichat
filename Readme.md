#  MediChat: AI Medical Research Assistant

**MediChat** is an interactive AI tool built to assist in medical literature review and research support. It allows users to upload PDFs or enter URLs of medical articles, then ask questions and receive responses grounded in those sources. All Q&A interactions and document chunks are logged in Firestore for transparency and traceability.

---

## Features

- Upload up to **3 PDFs**
- Add up to **3 medical article URLs**
- Ask natural medical questions like _“What are early signs of Parkinson’s?”_
- Responses are retrieved from embedded sources using **ChromaDB**
- Q&A and document chunks are saved to **Google Firestore**
- Toggle between **strict retrieval mode** and **AI-assisted mode**
- Simple and responsive **Streamlit UI**

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical_research_bot.git

cd medical_research_bot

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the root:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=medic-hat-firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx.json
Ensure the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS path is valid and the JSON file is in the root directory.

▶Run the App

streamlit run main.py

How It Works

1. **Document Ingestion**
   - PDFs are parsed using `PyMuPDFLoader`
   - URLs are processed using `UnstructuredURLLoader`

2. **Text Chunking**
   - Extracted content is split into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`

3. **Embedding & Storage**
   - Each chunk is embedded using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small`
   - Embedded chunks are:
     - Stored locally in **ChromaDB** (`db/chroma_db/`)
     - Archived in **Firestore** under the `articles/` collection with metadata

4. **Question Answering**
   - When a user asks a question, relevant chunks are retrieved from **ChromaDB**
   - LangChain’s **ConversationalRetrievalChain** feeds these chunks into **GPT-4**, generating a grounded, context-aware answer

5. **Logging**
   - Each interaction is logged to **Firestore** in the `qa_logs/` collection, including:
     - Question
     - Answer
     - Cited sources
     - Timestamp
